# Wave Tracing

This is a work-in-progress project aimed at highly optimized wave simulations in C++ with support for GPU Compute and volume visualization. Currently, there is no support for any form of visualization or a GUI, and everything runs multi-threaded on the CPU. The plan is to integrate Vulkan to hopefully implement volume ray casting, as well as a compute shader for performing the simulation on the GPU.

You can check out [my Python wave simulation project](https://github.com/bean-mhm/wave-simulation-py), which explains the basics and the wave equation.
